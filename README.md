## The App Idea
To create a hotel management application, which includes a web portal that allows people to book an available room and a desktop app for when they check in (when they arrive at the hotel).

I'm going to create a minimum viable product that will allow the customer to get going and to identify what features should be added later on.

Fyi this project is from a tutorial that I'm following. I'm doing this in order to learn:
- SQL Database design.
- Creating a SQL Data Access Layer.
- ASP.NET Razor Pages.
- WPF Core.

Side note: My early commit messages sometimes refer to stored procedures as storage procedures, which is wrong.
